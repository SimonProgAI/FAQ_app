USER STORIES
    -As a user, I want to find answers to commonly asked questions.
    -As a user, I want to ask questions to which I cannot find a satisfying answer.
    -As a user, I want to resgister and use the website.

OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
    The project is structured like a Q&A page with frequently asked questions grouped in categories, 
    with category 5 reserved for user generated questions. Users can submit questions of their own.
    The page is using a MySQL database to store usernames and passwords, as well as questions/answers. 
    Users cannot access the Q&A dashboard unless they use valid credentials.

IDEAS FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
    The category menu can be swapped for the question list.
    Include a user profile.
    Build the page around a theme and have pictures and video elements associated with some of the questions.
